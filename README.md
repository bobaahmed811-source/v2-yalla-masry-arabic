# Yalla Masry Academy - The Fresh Start

This is a clean foundation for the project. We are rebuilding it step-by-step to ensure a successful deployment on Vercel.

## Step 1: Push the Clean Foundation

1.  **Stage all changes:**
    ```sh
    git add .
    ```

2.  **Commit the changes:**
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Foundation: Initial clean project structure"
    ```

3.  **Push the changes:**
    ```sh
    git push
    ```

Vercel will now attempt to build this minimal project. If it succeeds, we will move to the next step of re-integrating the application features.
